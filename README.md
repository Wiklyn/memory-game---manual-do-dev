## Overview

The game has a "login" page with an input to get the name of the player, and a button to start the game. The button is disabled until the user puts a name of 3 characters, at minimum. When starting the game, the player is redirected to another page where there are the cards, the player name and a timer counting how long the player is gonna take to find all the pairs. When they do, an alert shows up on the screen congratulating the player and the timer stops. Sometimes the screen flips for some unknown reason (to me).
